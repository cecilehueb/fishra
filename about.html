          A while ago, not far from here, in the stormy story sewer, swam a
          hungry fish with keen fins and greedy gills, eating what she found:
          fact or fict, she didn’t care. Seaweeds, seawords, swords, mouldy
          pirates’ t-shirts, she ate it all up. From sky high to hell low, bible
          to belly, fairytop to fairytail, she swam and ate and swam and ate.
          Occasionally red faced pleasure cruise passengers would throw tiramisu
          or pieces of flame grilled steak overboard for her. Once she got
          caught on a fisherman’s hook but she escaped with a scar to prove it.
          After several years she looked back at her body and realised she was
          no longer a fish but a ship with huge fun- nels and roaring engines
          and greasy cabins. Appalled at this cumbersome situation, she resolved
          to lose excess baggage, and cough cough bleurgh, she spewed out the
          entire contents of her body. Then she swam off. Two restaurant
          managers who happened to be out sailing in the sewers, came upon the
          potent smelling remains of the fish’s insides. The bottled it up and
          became very rich selling fish sauce.

          Fishra uses film and music to tell old stories and tell them again,
          fresher: Niche narratives are deployed for social and political
          comment. Speedy speech joins hands with wild props and costumes to
          turn familiar setting inside out and upside down. She likes words.
          Phonically, meaningfully, in sense and nonsense. Fishra recently
          graduated from the audio-visual department of the Gerrit Rietveld
          Academie. She lives and works in Amsterdam.
