<br>our story goes from gore to glory.  
<br>hurry now it’s hot a minute’s all I’ve got to tell you 
<br>long far ago when feet were webbed and quack meant squawk and squeal meant quack and honk made sense  
<br>they came to stuff my neck. Knock knock who’s there? 
<br>‘the butchers, here to slit your throat and peel its skin and simmer in stock and drop in a stew’ they said
<br>‘we’ll sew up the top then a knot in the bottom will do, the stuffing won’t get through’
<br>stuff you! I said and flicked and flapped and flew 
<br>‘your filling acquires a melting soft texture’ they tried to say, 
<br>but I was away and out of the frying pan into the fray.
<br>the sisters soared and spared no words 
<br>they ranted and roared and clack clack attack with beaks and tiny teeth.
<br>with a mighty feather and an outstretched wing, with signs and wonder, 
<br>with fright and fight, our necks are ours. 
<br>we live to honk another tale

        THE FISH PRINCE
</p>
<p>
rolling through the middle
<br>of the aisles of the lidl 
<br>in the fridge sits a fish
<br>tail in a twist
<br>shaking belly top flap flop
 </p>

<br>‘I’m a fish prince, me
<br>set me free free me
<br>out of vacuum packed suction wrapped 
<br>sweaty plastic trap
<br>Rescue fish you’ll have a wish 
<br>And wet wet sea kiss’
 </p>
 <p>
I tear off his wrapping 
<br>the deluxe lidl branding 
<br>and fish boy spills out from his gills 
<br>gasps of relief, smiles, flash of teeth and a wink 
<br>‘one wish one wish whaddaya want whaddaya think’
 </p>
well fish I’m sick of the holes in my socks it sucks
<br>and sick of the stains in the sink and the stink 
<br>of this nasty coffee not so frothy
<br>Want bigger richer sweeter hotter better more.

<br>Out of vacuum packed suction wrapped 
<br>sweaty plastic trap’

<br>and wet wet sea kiss’
</p>

<br>fish prince winks a wink 
<br>‘your wish one wish whaddaya want whaddaya think’  
</p>

<br>you set me free let me be 
<br>out of vacuum packed suction wrapped 
<br>sweaty plastic trap
<br>you rescued fish you take your wish
<br>and wet wet sea kiss’
</p>
<p>
now with a chatter and a bang and a rattle
<br>stand a gaggle of men with trays in my trolley
<br>and boys smiling trolly:
<br>bouncers cooks cleaners waiters chaueferrs lovers others more
<br>fish prince winks a wink 
<br>your wish one wish whaddaya want whaddaya think  
</p>

she bought two tickets to go and see it. and brought her father in law.
<br>and it was a bit flat, not very lively, missed a spark.
<br>where are the special effects, she wondered, but didn’t mention it to her father in law in case he thought she was being dim, not appreciating the minimalist lighting. Instead she just said ‘it’s very contemporary, isn’t it, ‘the end’’
