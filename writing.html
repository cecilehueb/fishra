   </p>
   <p>
  I tear off his wrapping 
  <br>the deluxe lidl branding 
  <br>and fish boy spills out from his gills 
  <br>gasps of relief, smiles, flash of teeth and a wink 
  <br>‘one wish one wish whaddaya want whaddaya think’

  <br>out of vacuum packed suction wrapped 
  <br>sweaty plastic trap
  <br>you rescued fish you take your wish
  <br>and wet wet sea kiss’
  </p>
  <p>

  <br>where are the special effects, she wondered, but didn’t mention it to her father in law in case he thought she was being dim, not appreciating the minimalist lighting. Instead she just said ‘it’s very contemporary, isn’t it, ‘the end’’

            <p>THE DEVIL’S THREE GOLDEN HAIRS</p>
            <p class="special">
              Lucky Hans was born in a birth caul and was therefore destined to
              marry the king’s daughter. The greedy, insecure King threw him in
              the river but he was fished out by a miller and his wife. Years
              later, the King chanced upon Hans when touring the kingdom and
              ordered him to the palace to deliver a letter which was, in fact,
              an instruction for his execution. But an empathetic band of
              robbers switched it for one that said that this boy was to marry
              the princess. The king arrived just in time for the wedding, and
              enraged, sent Hans off to Hell to get three of the Devil’s golden
              hairs. On his way he passed an empty well, a barren apple tree and
              the ferryman to the underworld who couldn’t stop rowing back and
              forth. He promised he would solve these problems by the time he
              returned. Down in Hell, the Devil’s Grandmother was sympathetic to
              Hans’ mission and turned him into an ant to hide in her skirt. The
              devil returned exhausted from his day’s devilling and fell into
              grandma’s lap where she stroked him and sung him to sleep. Each
              time she plucked a golden hair from his head he woke up in pain,
              but assuming that it was part of his dream, he told his night-time
              visions to Grandma: a dried-up well in a town square with a toad
              underneath blocking the flow, a tree that does not flower because
              of a mouse gnawing at its root, and a ferryman who can be freed
              just by placing his oar in the hands of his passenger on the
              river’s bank. Kitted out with this information and the three
              golden hairs, Hans set off back, providing the answers he
              overheard to the ferryman and to the villagers. He was rewarded
              for his wisdom with gold laden asses. At the palace, the King,
              shocked by Hans’s success, asked where he got all that gold and
              Hans told him it was across the river. The king cantered off to
              the river where the ferryman placed the oar in his hands and back
              and forth he has rowed forever and ever, till this very day
              (Grimm, 80).

              This is The Devil’s Three Golden Hairs, an ultimate teller’s tale
              concerned with communication and miscommunication of information,
              instruction, prophesy, packed with stock characters and scenes; it
              resembles several stories mashed together. Morally ambiguous
              representations of the Devil, his grandmother, hell; truth and
              tales and deceit, resist conventional ethical structures.

            <p>AT HELL’S KITCHEN TABLE</p>
            <p>
              The archetypal characters and situations of this particular fairy
              tale will be at our side as we are introduced chronologically to a
              troop of characters, from Sybil of Cumae to the goose in Untitled
              Goose Game. The Devil’s Grandmother, that gossiping storyteller,
              hosts us at her textual kitchen table where, just like in the tale
              of The Devil’s Three Golden Hairs, she is conveyor of information,
              secrets, answers, a connoisseur of: ‘orally transmitted narrative
              with a relaxed attitude to the reality principle and plots
              constantly refurbished in the retelling’ (Carter, 11) as one of
              Angela Carter’s definitions of fairy tales goes. Particularly
              intriguing about the Devil’s Grandmother is that she isn’t a fair
              maiden or a wicked witch or a disobedient wife or even a witty
              heroine. She appears only in one scene, but plays a crucial
              decision- making role in the plot, where Hans himself is entirely
              passive, riding his luck to a happy ending. She evades moral
              expectation and categorisation: the Devil and Hell are weighty
              negative associations to bear by any standard, more so the further
              back you go in Church-dominated European history; indeed, the
              first published English translation of the story replaced the
              Devil with a giant for fear of offending (Tatar, 157). And yet,
              she is not only merciful with Hans, but goes significantly out of
              her way to help him, motivated by curiosity for the devil’s
              secrets and the desire to communicate them (to Hans) for drama’s
              sake, for the sake of what happened next. In other words,
              motivated by her gossiping instinct. She combines magic powers
              with domestic powers: hiding ant Hans in her skirt is an
              especially strong matriarchal move, evoking similar
              back-to-the-womb instances from Mary as The Virgin of Mercy,
              depicted sheltering large groups of tiny people under her cloak
              (Sano di Pietro), all the way to Oskar’s storytelling Grandmother
              in Gunter Grass’s The Tin Drum who protects and hides both lover
              and grandchild under not one, but four skirts (Grass, 32). In From
              the Beast to the Blonde, Marina Warner associates the rise of the
              fairy tale as a printed genre with ‘permission to accept that
              between heaven and hell and purgatory there lies another kingdom,
              a realm of human fantasy, in which the traditional categories of
              good and evil clash and find resolution that differ from orthodox
              faith and even ethics’. The Devil’s Grandmother sits, in spite of
              her hellish title and home, in just this liminal moral space. This
              research is a rough guide to following her example: How can
              storytelling be used as a tool to build an alternative,
              non-establishment framework? Hopefully, the question can be
              answered through narrative archaeology, by excavating layers of
              shifting information, filtered through the perspectives of several
              gossiping storytellers. Angela Carter describes the process as
              ‘validating my claim to a fair share of the future by staking my
              claim to my share of the past’ (12).

              ‘The fates will leave me my voice, and by my voice I shall be
              known’ Said the Cumaean Sibyl to Aeneas when she realised that
              she’d asked a smitten Apollo to live a long life (‘till the crack
              of doom’) but forgotten also to request eternal youth and would
              therefore ‘shrink from her present fine stature into a tiny
              creature, shrivelled with age’ (Desonay, 53).

            <p>THE SECRET PLEASURE CAVE</p>
            <p>
              The Oracle, Teller and Trickster of legend fled to a concealed
              cave on the highest ridge of the Appenine mountains (still called
              Monti Sibillini in her honour) when Christianity’s tightening grip
              on the Roman Empire forbade her from practising her pagan arts:
              fortune telling, prophesising, making up stories, passing on
              information. Sibyl’s declaration of mighty vocal immortality
              echoes through to the present; she wasn’t shut up by the coming of
              Christ or the exiling of classical divinities or by the Witch
              Hunts or by any of history’s other attempts to silence women: by
              her voice she is known.
            </p>
            <p>
              She is a proto-Mother Goose; a ‘composite character of the female
              narrator’ as posited by Marina Warner (71). Beginning as Classical
              prophetess in pagan lore, daughter of Lamia the snake-woman and
              Zeus, she guides Aeneas to the underworld in Virgil’s epic and
              sells her oracles to Tarquin the Proud, the last king of Rome,
              then becomes a fata, an enchantress, in order to star in medieval
              legend, where she revels in accusations of pagan perversion and
              entangles herself with folklore of the fairy seductress: in a
              chivalric romance by Andrea de Barberino from 1391, Guerino the
              Wretch meets the Devil. Aiming to get his soul, the devil tempts
              him with news of a secret pleasure kingdom where Sibilla, a great
              enchantress lives with her fairy entourage. Guerino
              enthusiastically ventures forth and finds the beautiful Sibyl of
              Cumae with ‘breasts that seemed to be made out of ivory’ in a
              paradise of feasting and music and fruit and flowers where there
              is no pain or sorrow or ageing. She offers to find Guerino’s
              father for him if only he will become her lover but he resists
              seduction. And a good thing he did so too because one day, peeping
              under the fairies’ skirts, Guerino discovers that every Saturday,
              they turn into horrible creatures with deformed nether limbs.
              Furious, he avows his Christian virtue and escapes to Rome where
              the Pope absolves him of his year in the sinful company of the
              Sibyl (Warner, 5).
            </p>
            <p>
              The story has been told and retold again and again, the cave of
              delights appearing in high and low forms, literary and oral,
              including versions in which the gallant knight is not pardoned by
              Rome and so turns back and lives out the rest of his life in bliss
              with the Sibyl. After all, she’s only monstrous once a week. Magic
              practising pilgrims visited the realm in great numbers to consult
              the Sibyl’s ancient wisdom in the hope of strengthening their
              powers until papal authorities, worried about all that profanity,
              had the cave filled up in the seventeenth century. In 1898 a group
              of mountaineers reported that it had been dynamited (Warner, 10).
              These are extreme and physically destructive measures to take in
              order to silence an already millennia dead, mostly fictional
              woman. It is testament to the real threat posed by the female
              storyteller to authoritarian male doctrine .

            <p>PAGAN TO PIOUS</p>
            <p>
              And despite their best efforts and their dynamite, the Sybil
              dodged the puritanical Christian culture cull, surviving as ‘a
              hyphen between the old faith and the new’ (Warner, 70). Rather
              than being demolished, she was incorporated into the Christian
              scheme of redemption: the Sibyl was cast as a prophet of the
              Messiah, a forerunner of the faith, commended by no less than
              Saint Augustine as ‘a citizen of the city of God’ (Dronke, 13).
            </p>
            <p>
              Her warnings of the apocalypse were vehement and vague enough to
              be neatly recast as predictions of divine Judgement day. In the
              hands of Lactantius, an early Christian author, himself prosecuted
              for his religion in the Roman empire and then honourably restored
              with the conversion of emperor Constantine early in the fourth
              century AD, she is quoted as knowing about Jesus’s life in
              remarkable detail: ‘He will satisfy five thousand from five loaves
              and a fish of the sea.’ (Lane-Fox, 647)
            </p>
            <p>
              So entwined is she with Christianity, that one version of the
              Sibyllian legend says that she fled because, having predicted the
              birth of the saviour to a virgin, she expected to be the one
              chosen by God as the virgin mother of her own prophecy, bearing
              not just news of Christ, but also the baby himself, and on
              discovering that Mary had been given the role, took off to the
              mountain peaks in a fit of disgust (Neri, 213).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Cumaean Sibyl is maybe the most fabled of all the ten Sibyls
              who pronounce their oracles from every corner of the earth, each
              with their own attribute and particular prophecy yet functioning
              together as one archetypal figure; they shift fluidly between the
              Sibyls and Sibyl. This multiplicity provided rich scope for
              artists and storytellers who could put her in any number of
              outrageous heathen hats and situations and other stories. Anvd
              gave her endurance and flexibility as a mythic figure through
              time. She is a manifest narrator who welcomes more and more voices
              to tell with her. Sibyl then, is the Devil’s Grandmother’s
              Grandmother, pioneering inter-ethical surfing for the Devil’s
              Grandmother to follow in her wake when she comes along. The
              sibylline cavern of pleasure is a fruity, blooming manifestation
              of the hell full of the secrets and promises and shapeshifting
              that we recognise from the Grimm’s tale. The Devil’s Grandmother’s
              soothing head massage is perhaps less overtly erotic than when the
              Sibyl ‘lays down by [Guerino’s] side and shows him her beautiful
              white flesh’ (Desonay, 21) but they are parallel instances of
              physically gratifying men to secure information or promises.
              Though in neither story do these women wield their wiles from a
              place of necessity; they are writing the plot not escaping from
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dwellings of the Sibyl and Devil’s Grandmother, respectively
              lavish and cosy, fulfil in their moral ambiguity a function in
              thinking about forbidden, secret matters. Ostensible finger
              wagging and negative verdicts lightly cover the real point of
              these fantasy caves where enchantresses perform magic and wonder,
              delighting in invention free from orthodox constraint. Whereas the
              aged crone typically stands for vice, her moral deficit causing
              physical decrepitude and vice versa, here old age represents
              ancient wisdom. From Sibylline iconography springs the old wise
              woman as the imagined source of fairy tales.

              But although she is celebrated on the ceiling of the Sistine
              chapel (all ten of her), wrinkled and muscular (presumably from
              carrying all those heavy books around) and although her oracles
              reached wider secular audiences with the invention of the printing
              press, by the sixteenth Century she was branded a mouthpiece of
              the Devil by the era of witch terror: in the late middle ages,
              church and law launched an attack on female communication and
              networks. Collective knowledge as midwives and healers meant that
              women controlled illicit realms of sex, contraception, and
              abortion and therefore, also fertility, morality, attitudes, and
              alliances: Management of the physical and social body constituted
              a big threat (Federici, 29). The negative shift of the word
              ‘Gossip’ from early modern times to the late middle ages, charts
              the vilification of female companionship, social gathering,
              communication: In 1014, ‘gosssip’ meant a godmother or father, a
              morally important and comendable co-parent; by the mid 1300s it
              referred to a female friend invited to the a christening of a
              child. A ‘Gossiping’ was used to mean a christening feast. During
              the 1600s, as these celebrations grew into lavish occasions for
              socialising and bonding, the word ‘gossip’ came to hold
              associations of wickedness: a woman who delights in idle chatter
              (Warner, 33). In French, ‘commère’ and in Italian ‘commare’,
              follow similar downward spirals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Broadsheets denounced women’s rattling tongues, associating them
              with curses and spells. An English print from 1603 — ‘Tittle
              Tattle; or the several branches of Gossiping’ — warns of the
              places where women gather dangerously without supervsion, starting
              ‘At the Childbed’. Here, women friends of the new mother arrive to
              help with the birth. A 1508 prayer book shows the grim Reaper
              dancing off to the grave with a queen, a duchess, a regent, a
              knight’s lady, an abbess, a market vendor, every social group all
              the way down to the witch and the fool (Jeay, 95). A portrait of
              the Wise Woman reads, ‘Everyone look at me because I am a wise
              woman/ A golden padlock I wear on my mouth at all times’
              (Armstrong, 129). The scold’s bridle, a contraption like a dog
              muzzle, was invented to gag women found guilty of blasphemy. In
              1624 a law was passed in England against cursing by which mostly
              peasant women would be identified as witches in league with the
              devil by inquisitors, and burnt at the stake.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this environment, the Devil was believed to speak though the
              heathen Sibyls. Pierre de Lancre, an inquisitor sent to cleanse
              the Basque country of witches in 1608, reported sabbath orgies,
              night-flyings, obscene rites and women’s susceptibility to
              becoming possessed, mentioning ‘Fairies, Nymphs, Sibyls, White
              Ladies...’ (de Lancre, 89)

              So they lay forcibly dormant, until emerging enlightenment
              thinking slowly began to soften opinion. At the end of the
              seventeenth century, sceptics started doubting the notion that the
              Devil spoke through the pagan oracles (Warner, 78). The
              supernatural beings that accompanied him were stripped of their
              malignant power by the argument that they just didn’t exist.
              Fairyland was reasoned from diabolical threat to nonsense.
              Nonsense that could develop into a lurid and fantastical strand of
              entertainment: by no coincidence, the first collec- tions of
              written folk tales were being produced at this time, significantly
              Perrault’s Mother Goose tales, published in 1697, which brought
              Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, Blue Beard, Cinderella to
              a liter- ary audience and invented the fairy tale as a written
              genre and an area of study. As historical luck would have it, the
              Sibyl was poised on her mountain top, ready to leap into a combo
              role of Fairy Queen and Mother Goose. A collection of stories with
              the title Queen Mab: containing a selection of Only the Best, most
              Instructive and Entertaining Tales of the Fairies ends with a
              ditty: ‘This Tale a Sib- yl-Nurse a-read / And softly stroak’d my
              youngling Head, / And, when the Tale was done, / Thus some are
              Born, my Son (she cries) / With base Impediments to rise, - And
              some are born with none.’ (Queen Mab’s Song, 365) So she became
              the Sibyl-Nurse, still a wise teller, a purveyor of fortune, an
              educator, though more domesticated and probably with fewer teeth
              than her sexy predecessor. In this harmless guise, wrapped in
              blankets and bundled into a rocking chair, she could be a moral
              poster girl who legitimised fairy tales filled with violence, sex,
              extravagance, and fantasy as suitable for the education of
              children. The morphing character of the Sibyl unties her from any
              historical column. She is set loose to invent future fictions. But
              something is retained from the earliest recorded mention of her by
              Heraclitus in 500BC: ‘Sibyl with frenzied lips, uttering words
              mirthless, unembellished, unperfumed penetrates through a thousand
              years with her voice’ (McGinn, 8)

            <p>DORY PREVIN</p>
            <p>LIVING THE FAIRY TALE</p>
            <p>
              Dory Previn plays, in her life and in her lyrics, not only the
              Devil’s Grandmother, but also wife and daughter in a
              Hollywood-brand Hell of the 60s and 70s. As a radio interviewer
              once remarked, her life story reads like a fairy tale (BBC
              kaleidoscope): born in 1925, the eldest daughter of a poor, strict
              Irish Catholic family with a father who would rage then embrace
              and held the whole family at gunpoint in a locked attic for a
              month, she toured as a chorus-line dancer, then one day in a
              chance encounter with a film producer, got discovered as a lyrical
              talent, and in a few months had a contract at MGM, and had fallen
              in love with and married Andre Previn, a glamorous jazz prince
              (Weber, 23). Together they wrote Oscar winning movie numbers
              together until one day she discovered he’d been having an affair
              with the nymph-like Mia Farrow. Dory Previn was hospitalised after
              a mental breakdown and treated with electroshock-therapy
              (Ruhlman). When she recovered, she wrote her experience into
              parables of songs: spitting into the emerging second wave of
              feminism - tender, angry, cynically didactic tales populated by a
              cast of mythical kings, iguanas, angels and devils, dwarves,
              prophetic old men, Jesus, Jesus’ baby sister. Songs like Starlet
              Starlet on the Screen Who Will Follow Norma Jean? expose the lie
              of the fairy tale that Hollywood sells to women: “And you wait for
              the phone to ring / In a vine street motel / And you write your
              folks / That being in the movies is / Really, really swell / Well
              / If that’s anyone’s idea of heaven / Who do you have to fuck / To
              get into hell?”Three different systems of storytelling — the
              phone, a letter, the movies — mentioned just in this half verse of
              a song build an impression of the inter-media web of truths and
              half-truths and lies and fiction that showbiz, or ‘hell’, is built
              on. And just like the Devil’s Grandmother’s, Dory’s hell is one in
              which morality shifts trickily: ‘How do you make a virtue of a
              vice?’ (Starlet Starlet) she asks, accusing media moguls and their
              notorious casting couches of directing a sinful route to the
              silver screen. She swings between biblical and crude, the catholic
              daughter, and the chorus line girl. You don’t is the silent answer
              to the rhetorical question; spinning a vice into a virtue is like
              spinning straw into gold, there’s always a catch to this deal:
              only in exchange for your first born child; in exchange for sex;
              in exchange for your soul. Rumpelstiltskin stamps so hard that he
              falls right through the ground to the flaming centre of the earth
              and the miller’s daughter lives in her palace with her baby and
              her king happily ever after. Not so for Dory’s protagonists: if
              ever after is considered together with the premise ‘Female meat/
              Does not improve with time’(Starlet Starlet), it doesn’t look so
              happy.

            <p>OBSCENE GOSSIP</p>
            <p>
              Her use of fairy tale imagery and morality does contain a hefty
              dose of irony, but not just that: arguably, folklore has always
              functioned at its best when redirected to fight oppressive norms
              and power structures. It serves the Folk who serve it. There is
              room for criticism and celebration simultaneously. Whilst you
              don’t want your daughter in a Rock n Roll band, Folk music’s OK –
              it’s domestic, personal, safe, a genre that is within female reach
              for the same reasons as the folk tale is. In Dory’s hands,
              domestic and personal become anything but safe. She explodes ‘folk
              music’ from the inside and slurps up controversy like mother’s
              milk. If Joni Mitchell is singer-songwriter’s Cinderella then Dory
              Previn is her ugly stepsister. Folk music need only share a style
              and a storytelling temperament with actual “traditional” folk
              songs to be defined as folk mu- sic: There is no anxiety about
              self-consciously authored songs fraudulently tricking their way
              into the pure oral tradition, as there perhaps is with fairy
              tales; the genre stretches all the way to pop-idol worship in
              concert stadiums. But the traditional folk song function of
              relating news and anecdote (most efficient pre-newspaper method)
              at least ostensibly, is retained. These songs, then, stand in a
              global tradition of communication through unofficial channels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Actually they don’t stand in the tradition, they stamp in it: Dory
              whispers or screams her gossip straight into our ears. In an
              introduction to a performance of The Obscene Phone Call she
              confides, “I got a call the other day. The verbal flasher told me
              off, hung up and there I was stuck with the receiver in my hand.
              It wasn’t the call I minded so much, it was the hang up, after all
              he’d had his say and I didn’t have a chance to answer.” It’s
              outrageous that men, because they’re men, can be disgusting and
              irrelevant and still have the last word. Dory Previn is driven to
              snatching it back, extra-cathartically, in public. In the song,
              ev- ery level of male-led authority – the F.B.I, the C.I.A, the
              United Nations, dismiss her until eventually she calls GOD, who
              instead of helping, is ‘inclined to find this call of [Dory’s]
              obscene’ and then hangs up. This caricatured complaint about
              complaining is filed: women’s voices are continually shut down by
              establish- ment powers, supposedly here to serve and protect us,
              so that, by necessity, we broadcast through our own channels. It
              is an instance of rehearsed gossip, functioning on an expanded,
              public scale.

            <p>VILLAINS AND VICTIMS</p>
            <p>
              In Did Jesus Have a Sister? she tackles the biggest boy in
              masculine hero history - Christ Himself. And examines the moral
              status of men and women in our culturally defining narratives:
              ‘And in private to her mirror/ Did she whisper/ Saviourette?/
              Saviouwoman?’ Here, just as in Snow White, the mirror equals self-
              awareness and self-identification. Wicked Stepmother and Jesus’
              sister, fall on this source of recognition in absence of
              recognition from the outside world. It denotes vanity in the
              wicked stepmother, but when Jesus’ sister does it, we
              reverentially pity her. She is a martyr to aborted potential. So
              to speak. The Heavenly Lord, ‘The chief / The man / The show’ (Did
              Jesus) is at best, boastful and attention seeking. Heroes and
              Villains, then, are replaced with Posers and Victims, a cynic’s
              guide to morality. They may not be as emancipated as the Devil’s
              powerful, heroic Grandmother, but if these female protagonists are
              not freed from victimhood, at least they get to talk about it.

              Untitled Goose Game was hatched when an employee of House House -
              the Austrailan video game company - posted a stock photograph of a
              goose in the company’s internal communications (McMaster). This
              led to a conversation about geese. And what emerged in 2019 was a
              video game in which it’s a lovely morning in the village and you
              are a horrible goose. So the official strapline goes. Players
              control a goose on the loose whose objective is to wreak havoc on
              an idyllic English village through pranks and thievery and
              vandalism (Untitled Goose Game).
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the game’s release, the goose has become the charmingly and
              cathartically anarchic hero of an entire genre of internet memes,
              with several twitter accounts and facebook pages devoted to
              spreading the honk; an icon of transgression and irreverence for
              its own sake, the devil-may-care style entertainment that thrives
              on social media (Fox). It joins the flock of internet birds that
              in their militant bird-nature, denounce incompetent and/or evil
              human management of world affairs.

            <p>GOOSE-LORE</p>
            <p>
              Keeping in mind the rich goose-loric tradition of oral
              storytelling, it is curious that they raise their heads now as
              stubbornly non-verbal bringers of chaos. They have prolific
              history both as gossiping fools and wise tellers, decidedly female
              ones: ‘Many women, many words; many geese many turds’ says an old
              English proverb (Coates, 31). A French fable from the seventeenth
              century tells how a husband as a test of his wife’s discretion,
              shouts out in the night that he has laid an egg. She rushes to
              tell the neighbour and the egg grows four times the size; the
              neighbour runs on and the egg becomes three eggs and so on until
              the whole town marvels that he has laid a hundred (La Fontaine,
              223). The egg grows just like the lie and the storytelling goose
              is stupid enough to believe her own story. In the folk tale
              Chicken Licken, Chicken Licken thinks the sky is falling down when
              an acorn hits her on the head and finds Goosey Loosey and the
              other birds who all process together to tell the King that the sky
              is falling. On the way they meet Foxy Loxy who invites them into
              his lair and gobbles them up (Stimson). The punishment for gossip
              here is death. Gullible Jemima Puddle Duck falls for the same
              trick in Beatrix Potter’s children’s book from 1908, when a fox
              offers her lodgings in his house, but luckily she’s rescued by a
              collie dog at the last minute (this story is a reworking of Little
              Red Riding Hood). The Gabble twins, Amelia and Abigail, in
              Disney’s Aristocats are compacted English goose caricatures, who
              wear the same hats and capes as Jemima Puddle duck. They are
              irritatingly bossy and uptight and cannot shut up while they
              waddle to Paris. Later with their drunken uncle Waldo, they round
              off the goose archetype by shouting bawdy distasteful jokes, honk
              honk. Primarily, these geese are ridiculing talkative women. But,
              there is an alternate goose-identity as bearer of ‘hidden
              foreknowledge both ominous and wonderful’ (Warner, 58): in Greek
              mythology, they are the sacred bird of Neitho the nymph who
              personifies persuasion. The goose at her side represents her sweet
              talking tongue. Choose Goose in the cartoon TV series Adventure
              Time is a merchant of rare objects and insights which he dispenses
              exclusively in rhyming couplets. Mostly his advice and merchandise
              backfire or prove to be useless but he retains his swivel-eyed
              bardic mysticism. In Charlotte’s Web, the unnamed goose coaxes
              Wilbur the pig to speak, so setting the plot in motion (White).
              She repeats all her words thrice and at speed and suggests that
              ‘TERRIFIC TERRIFIC TERRIFIC’ should be woven into the spider web
              to impress the farmer. It seems appropriate that Oprah Winfrey,
              big-league talker and gossip chief, voiced her in the 2006 live
              action version of the film. The Brothers Grimm, provide a truism
              at the beginning of their tales ‘birds converse together on the
              destinies of men’ (Grimm, 672).
            </p>
            <p>
              So, Mother Goose is a language wielding, prophet-fool hybrid,
              occupying a fluid moral status not unlike that of the Devil’s
              Grandmother who also is wise but somewhat ridiculous; kind but
              frightening; domestic but powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arguably, Untitled Goose Game’s inherent humour has to do with the
              discrepancy between fictional goose representation and what geese
              are really like: aggressive and jarringly loud with sharp teeth,
              rather than, talkative, cuddly, hearthside grannies. House House
              juxtaposes its non-traditional goose with archetypal English
              village setting. The domesticity and commonness of this bird, the
              same features that qualify it for its specific role in story and
              myth, also mean that its real-life behaviour is recognisable,
              caricatured in this game to comic effect. Goose propensity for
              narrative has maybe diminished, but they have found a new medium
              through which to broadcast the concerns and antics of the people:
              yesterday’s mother goose is today’s meme lord.

            <p>MEME STAR</p>
            <p>
              Richard Dawkins coined the term meme in his 1976 book The Selfish
              Gene — a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols or practises,
              passed from mind to mind through mimicry in writing, speech,
              gestures, rituals: the cultural equivalent of biological genes
              (352). When the word was taken up decades later in its now most
              familiar usage, referring to viral internet phenomena, Dawkins
              characterised these kind of memes as deliberately altered by human
              creativity as opposed to mutating ‘by random change and a form of
              Darwinian selection’ (Solon). Fairy tales fit snugly within this
              updated definition. Daniel Dennet describing the implications of
              memes as ‘the idea of my brain as a sort of dung heap in which the
              larvae of other people’s ideas renew themselves, before sending
              out copies of themselves in an informational Diaspora,’ (202)
              could apply convincingly to the role of fairy tales in the public
              consciousness. Considering the influence of internet memes in
              social and political discussion, considering their moral
              convictions, their entertainment value, their anonymous origins,
              their continual adaptation, their open accessibility, the
              unofficial networks through which they are communicated, it seems
              useful to see them as fulfilling the fairy tale function in the
              modern day.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are formal parallels, like framing stories with other
              stories and memes with other memes: Hans Christian Andersen opens
              The Bog King’s Daughter, with the words: ‘The storks know two
              stories that are very ancient and very long: one of them is the
              story of Moses. The other is a fairy tale that has been told by
              stork mothers for a thousand years. The first storks who told it
              had experienced it themselves’ (278). This use of meta-narrative,
              in which the telling of the story is itself a story, sends us
              deeper into the frame- work of fairy-land: the ancient storks bear
              witness to the fiction and authenticate it, carrying one more
              layer of suspended disbelief. In the story of Moses mentioned
              here, sacred ibises, not storks, are the birds to see the baby
              prophet in his basket among the bulrushes, picked out of the river
              Nile by pharaoh’s daughter (not unlike lucky Hans). From goose to
              stork to ibis, big birds have flexible identities that shift
              depending on which species is familiar in any given setting. This
              is true also among birds featured in memes:
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, the aptly-named Drake performs a compere roll similar to the
              storks in the Hans Christian Andersen story. The meme page
              Untitled Leftist Goose narrates and Drake, with heavy-weight meme
              icon status, endorses the birbs (who cares what kind). large part
              of meme and of fairy tale appeal lies in recognisable characters
              and objects that become relatable in the cultural landscape: They
              work with a symbolic, self-referential language. And in this stock
              cast, talking animals, birds in particular, abound. They stand as
              alternatives to a dominant establishment perspective: oppressed
              non-human species, who against the odds and laws of reality, are
              voicing opinions. More broadly, we can look at this as part of
              fantasy’s liberating function; that it allows us to imagine
              hierarchies and systems that are different from the existing ones.

            <p>HONK</p>
            <p>
              The horrible goose, like many meme stars, delights in riotous
              entertainment for entertainment’s sake, a spirit which has been
              commandeered in recent times by the alt-right within internet
              culture. This propensity in memes towards anti-ideology is not
              expressly right wing or conservative but according to Angela
              Nagle, evidence for ‘the hegemony of the culture of
              non-conformism, self-expression, transgression and irreverence for
              its own sake—an aesthetic that suits those who believe in nothing
              but the liberation of the individual and the id’ (37). And with
              this attitude the horrible goose honks its catchphrase: ‘Peace was
              Never an Option’ (Untitled Goose Game).
            </p>
            <p>
              The writer Lawrence Millman said ‘Chance is the mother of
              invention,’ on hearing the richness of local folk-stories when in
              the Arctic. He added ‘Invention is also the mother of invention’.
              A story from Angela Carter’s Virago collection, flaunting its
              self-expression and its own inventiveness,makes his point:
            </p>
            <p class="special">
              So one woman after another straightaway brought forth her child.
              Soon there was a whole row of them. Then the whole band departed,
              making a confused noise. When the girl saw that, she said: ‘There
              is no joke about it now. There comes a red army with umbilical
              cords still hanging on.’ (3)
            </p>
            <p>
              This type of story and goose memes share a mood, ebulliantly
              refusing logic and defying analysis. Take the irreverant nonsense
              a step further and you get *honking* the universally repurposable
              expression of aggression, that makes the horrible goose so very
              memeable:
            </p>
            <img src="img/writing/ceffylpren.png" />
            <p>
              It is anti-verbal, with the cathartic quality of a scream, beyond
              criticism or explanation. Its non-specificity makes it applicable
              to an infinite range of situations. And within the goose game
              universe the Honk is not impotent and ridiculous as we know it to
              be in real life, but dangerous and effective:
            </p>
            <p>
              21 Sep 2019 I got a suggestion to use a turbo button controller
              for the honk button. I have weaponized this goose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through pages like Untitled Leftist Goose, the Goose retaliates
              against the far-right trolls who rampage through the internet. It
              has been adopted as a symbol of anti-capitalist resistance. This
              makes sense considering the aim of the game is to disturb the
              workings of a smug, upper-class, presumably conservative,
              presumably non-progressive, village, rather than just causing
              indiscriminate chaos. Tactical disruption of a capitalist system
              by a marginal figure certainly sounds like political action. This
              extends intuitively, free from analytic process, in different
              directions:
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              That memes are so integrated into communication and socialising –
              conversations can be held through pure meme exchange, and often a
              meme replaces a comment as a concise illustration of what needs to
              be expressed – makes them important gossip components. As
              demonstrated in the two news-commentary-joke combos above. Spread
              on global social networks, instead of round the kitchen table,
              gossip is exponentialised. Meaning that non- establishment
              politics have more clout and more consequences on the offices of
              power than ever before, as we have seen terrifyingly with the rise
              of populism in Europe and America. Even if Trump’s election
              shouldn’t be entirely accredited to memes and internet trolling,
              their power, whether imaginary or not, is clearly huge – the hype
              is real.

              What does it mean for this non-verbal, non-narrative form to be
              the new fairytale? Where fairytales are garrulous and spun out,
              designed to extract as much entertainment from a story as possible
              in the days before TV existed, memes are ultimately boiled down,
              to squeeze a message into a half-second between constantly
              competing stimuli. With thrust and concision comes simplification.
              In times when politicians/devils like Boris Johnson and Donald
              Trump cultivate a simple idiot image to gain popularity, with the
              pretense of being anti-establishment, a rising prominence of dumb,
              anti-linguistic expression becomes a scary prospect. Should we be
              alarmed that honking has replaced storytelling?

            <p>DIGGING UP THE UNDERWORLD</p>
            <p>
              Angela Carter offers her collection of fairy tales ‘in a
              valedictory spirit, as a reminder of how wise, clever, perceptive,
              occasionally lyrical, eccentric, sometimes downright crazy our
              great grandmothers were, and their great grandmothers; and of the
              contributions to literature of mother goose and her goslings’ (9)
            </p>
            <p>
              This document also should be a reminder and a tribute though not a
              valediction: The Devil’s Grandmother doesn’t bid us farewell
              because she’s seen enough heroes and villains come and go from her
              cave looking for hairs or for secrets or for the truth, to know
              that we will keep coming and going. She’s not alarmed: her
              professional security is covered. She looks on omnisciently and
              smiles at our quest. We don’t know yet whether her grin is wicked
              or benign. She lives off telling and retelling, on a diet of
              narrative artifacts, like this one. She’s no snob: she’ll gobble
              up fact and fiction, high and low, reliable and dubious; as long
              as the source has flavour, she doesn’t care who cooked it. This
              egalitarian attitude, the bottom-up nature of fairy tale telling,
              is disruptive to hierarchies. According to Phaedrus the Roman
              Fabulist who first wrote down Aesop’s Tales, it is with conscious
              intention that they determinedly and repeatedly cheer on the
              underdog. It is built into their original function:
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I will briefly explain how the type of thing called fable was
              invented. The slave being liable to punishment for any offence,
              since he dared not say out-right what he wished to say, projected
              his personal sentiments into fables, and eluded censure under the
              guise of jesting with made up stories. (Phaedrus, 245)
            </p>
            <p>
              Sibyl, Dory, and the Goose agree. They are aware of their own
              storytelling purpose, taking a voice from their position as a
              teller: they don’t just tell, they tell about telling. And not
              just about their own telling but about the narrative layer
              underneath, and the one under that, and the one under that, until
              eventually you reach the underworld where the Devil’s Grandmother
              sits in her cave, the roof trembling under the weight of all those
              stories but somehow never falling in.

              Susan Shapiro, the American author, takes up the self-conscious
              excavation effort with great enthusiasm and great unsubtlety –
              she’s using a shovel not a brush – in her 1978 film, Rapunzel Let
              Down Your Hair. My mum, playing her part in the intergenerational
              story relay, told me about it on Whatsapp: ‘Hey. Do your know a
              film by Susan Shapiro called rapunzel let down your hair - an
              imaginative experimental and playful look at myth storytelling and
              female identity. Sounds like your kind of territory. I watched it.
              V fascinating and odd and massively strong interesting flavour of
              1978 and simple simple animation and all the anxieties and
              aspirations and optimism of then...’
            </p>
            <p>
              In the film, a mother reads her daughter the story of Rapunzel,
              accompanied by cut out animations. It is then retold five times,
              each version reinterpreting and recontextualising the
              relationships - from the prince as voyeuristic film noir detective
              trying to rescue a heroin addicted sex slave Rapunzel from the top
              of a tower block, to the witch as a feminist doctor specialising
              in contraception, shocked when her teenage daughter reveals that
              she is pregnant and intends to keep the baby, to Rapunzel as a
              struggling single mother of twins, liberated when she ‘lets her
              hair down’, at an all women’s party, unleashing her voice, backed
              by a mullet headed funk band. An essay about medieval witch hunts
              and the role of witches in the collective imagination today is
              spliced into the middle of the film. It is unapologetically clunky
              and explicit in laying bare the workings of the fairy tale, its
              symbols, its past and future lives. By watching it, you are made
              part of the tale relay.
            </p>
            <p>
              To end a story, Russian narrators tell their audience: ‘The tale
              is over. I can’t lie any more’ (Carter, 8). With the verbal
              equivalent of a wink, they acknowledge the fiction of fiction, and
              so legitimise it: There’s no pretence going on here, officer. When
              we hear ‘once upon a time’, or any of its variants – like the
              emphatically enigmatic Armenian version ‘There was a time and no
              time’, or the teasey ‘There was and there was not, there was a
              boy’ – we know that what we are being told isn’t going to pretend
              to be true. We listen with awareness that asks us to appreciate
              the invention, and maybe we think about it, and maybe we act on
              it. These stories not only comprise our subconscious cultural
              terrain — they alter conscious opinions, they change minds.

              The thirst for what happened next? is unquenchable. Fairy tales,
              the narratives without originators that can be remade by each
              person who tells them, whether they tell about local gossip, or
              about international affairs, or about a sausage keeping house with
              a cat, whether carved on a stone tablet or blasted on a car radio,
              or posted on facebook will be recycled and redistributed to
              infinity. This is my story, I’ve told it and in your hands I leave
              it.

              We took the ferry down to hell to ask the Devil’s Grandmother how
              to build an alternative non-establishment framework from stories.
              She leaned close so we could feel her fiendish breath on our cheek
              and hear her morally ambiguous heart beating, and she told us to
              try it and see for ourselves.
